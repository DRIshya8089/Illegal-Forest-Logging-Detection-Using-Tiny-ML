## Illegal-Forest-Logging-Detection-Using-Tiny-ML: Anomaly Detection Model

Illegal logging poses a significant threat to biodiversity, forest ecosystems, and climate stability. This project aims to create a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and real-time monitoring system that detects unauthorized tree cutting, forest disturbances, and trespassing within forested or protected areas using TinyML and IoT devices. Low-powered edge devices equipped with TinyML models are trained using Edge Impulse Studio to recognize some specific sounds. Activities such as chainsaw use, axe chopping, or tree felling indicate potential logging, while human voices or unauthorized vehicle sounds suggest possible trespassing. Sensor fusion is incorporated to distinguish environmental conditions like rainfall or wildfire risk by analyzing combined patterns of sound and temperature data. Multiple edge nodes using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (which has an onboard microphone and sensors), data are processed locally. When an anomaly sound is detected, the system sends an alert using LoRa communication to a central dashboard for authorities to take immediate action. This project provides a sustainable, smart, and localized surveillance network for forests. It empowers conservation teams, forest rangers, and local governments with real-time intelligence to curb illegal activities, improve biodiversity protection, and contribute to global climate goals.

Here given is a sample dashboard made with streamlit that only includes the front-end features, showing what all initial features are needed in the dashboard.
